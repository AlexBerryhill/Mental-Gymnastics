Guide to Running Two Tello Drones with a Muse 2 Headset Using the Provided Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Prepare Your Drones
   - Power up each Tello Edu drone.
   - Set each drone to AP Mode using the provided set-ap-mode.py script.
     Example:
         python set-ap-mode.py -s "Walking BCD" -p "Alexander"
   - Confirm that the drone responds with “ok” messages, which indicates that the drone is in AP mode.
     (AP Mode means the drone is acting as a Wi‑Fi client and is ready for swarm programming.)

2. Set Up Your Computer Environment
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
   - Install the required Python packages:
         conda install -y -c conda-forge netifaces netaddr
         pip install muselsl
     (The 'muselsl' library is used for streaming EEG data from the Muse 2 headset.)
   - Connect your Muse 2 headset to your computer via Bluetooth.
   - Verify that your Muse 2 is streaming EEG data (for example, by using the muselsl stream command).

3. Run the Swarm Programming Code
   - Create a command file (e.g., cmds-01.txt) containing the commands for the drones.
     Example command file contents:
         scan 2
         battery_check 20
         1>takeoff
         2>takeoff
         delay 5
         1>land
         2>land
   - Run the planned-flight.py program with the command file:
         python planned-flight.py -f cmds-01.txt
     This program uses the TelloManager and related classes to send commands from the file to the drones.

4. Integrate Muse 2 EEG Data for Control
   - Use a Python library (such as muselsl) to stream EEG data from the Muse 2 headset.
   - Write or modify a Python script that:
       * Reads the EEG data from the Muse 2.
       * Processes the EEG signals to detect specific patterns (e.g., a blink or concentration threshold).
       * Maps the detected signal to a Tello command (for example, a blink might trigger "takeoff" or "land").
       * Uses the Tello or TelloManager objects to send the corresponding command to the drones.
     Example:
         if blink_detected:
             drone1.send_command("takeoff")
             drone2.send_command("takeoff")
     This script acts as the bridge between your Muse 2 headset input and the swarm commands.

5. Run Your Integrated Control Program
   - Launch your integration script that ties together EEG data reading and Tello swarm control.
   - As you generate EEG signals (by blinking or focusing), your program should interpret these signals and send the mapped commands to both drones.
   - Monitor console output or log files to confirm that the commands are sent and that the drones respond correctly.

6. Safety and Testing
   - Always test your setup in a safe, open environment free of obstacles.
   - Start with simple commands (such as takeoff and land) to ensure your EEG-to-command mapping works as expected.
   - Calibrate your EEG signal processing thresholds until you achieve reliable control over the drones.
   - Gradually introduce more complex control commands once you’re confident in the system’s reliability.

Summary:
-------------
1. Set each Tello drone to AP Mode using the provided script.
2. Ensure your computer environment is set up with the required Python version and libraries.
3. Create and run a command file using the planned-flight.py program.
4. Connect your Muse 2 headset and stream EEG data.
5. Develop a script that maps EEG signals to Tello commands and integrates with the swarm code.
6. Test your system in a controlled, safe environment and calibrate your controls.

This guide provides a straightforward roadmap to integrate the provided swarm code with your Muse 2 headset to control two Tello drones simultaneously.
